Description: This package introduces a parametric estimator of the mean number
  of events in the presence of ceompeting events. The estimator is based on a 
  joint flexible parametric model (FPM) for the recurrent and competing event 
  process and includes a wrapper for `rstpm2::stpm2()` which implements an 
  easy specification of such models.
